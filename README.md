# grrcon-2025
My notes and observations from GrrCon 2025.

## tl;dr

It was another great year with some big misses in my opinion. Still worth going every year. Learned a few new things; met some decent vendors; really enjoyed social networking; hosted an awesome meetup; and decided to submit a presentation for next year.

## the sessions

At a high level I attended the following sessions: 

### thursday 

1. Thursday Keynote “Mystery Company: The case of the ghost on the wire” by Rachel Giacobozzi.
2. “You Trained It on Trash and Gave It Root Access” by Andrew Orr.
3. “The role of Data and AI Governance in 2025 Data Strategy” by Holly Anderson.
4. “Cracking The Code: Understanding & Defending Against the OWASP Top 10” by Micah Silverman.
5. “Surviving the Vulnerability Abyss: A CISO’s Perspective on Costly Vendor Solutions, Politics, Prioritization, and the limits of Pentesting” by Jason Bevis.
6. “Building a Local LLM-Based Vulnerability Scanner” by Dmitry Moiseev.

### friday 

1. “Hackers Don’t Hack, They Log In” by Dr. Louis DeWeaver III.
2. “Automating the boring part: Penetration Testing VMs deployment as Code” by Jacob Harrand.
3. “Vibe or Die – Rapid Prototyping Cyber Solutions with AI” by Chas Clawson.
4. “An Old Hillbilly’s Guide to BASH for Pentests: Automating, Logging, and Covering Your Butt” by Adam Compton.
5. “Just Context: Interpretable ML for Root Cause and Attack Flow Discovery” by Ezz Tahoun.
6. “Evolution of Cyber Security and the Ransomware Gap” by Abu Yera.
7. “On the Care and Feeding of CyberNinjas – 2025” by Atlas of Doom.

## my highlights

Here are some of my high level thoughts on various sessions. My apologies as I did not take detailed notes this year because… a lot of the sessions just were not very informative or new or exciting. 

- The Thursday keynote was not well executed for the audience. I think Rachel is a great person and she does fantastic work in cybersecurity. She also has such a unique way of teaching. It just didn’t translate to a keynote. 
- Andrew gave a good talk that can be summed up as “Attackers like to use LLMs for attacking.” Not a ton of new information that can be turned into action.
- Holly’s talk was good on content but at the end of the day it was just a pitch for the vendor. If the question is “Should we have governance over data?” then the answer is “Yes” and here is a product/vendor to help. 
- Same for Micah’s OWASP talk. At the end of the day it’s a pitch for Snyk.io. 
- Jason’s talk wasn’t the most exciting but it was down to earth and actually talked about the topic – fixing vulnerabilities and eliminating blindspots – which was very cool to learn about. His advocacy for using good AI prompts to help with visibility was new and taught me something.
- I’ll be honest I don’t recall anything from Dmitry’s presentation. 
- The Friday keynote by Louis DeWeaver was fantastic! I think we need to call out the bullshit and bad vendors more often. I’m glad to see the work he is working on. I should follow him more closely.
- Jacob’s talk was also very good! Full disclosure he is a friend (and peer competitor). I’ve already provided some private critiques and I look forward to seeing him speak at future conferences. 
- Chas Clawson gave a vendor talk that somehow wasn’t a vendor talk. I actually liked the content and the idea of “vibe coding” has been a new fixture in my weeks as I continue to develop my automations. 
- Adam’s BASH scripts and processes was educational. Could have gone a bit deeper, especially on daily-use scripts when doing pentesting. 
- I’ll be honest: I almost walked out of Ezz Tahoun’s talk. There was no real content shared, Ezz spent more time asking the audience questions “What do you think?” “What are we looking at?” “What would you do?” and less time sharing how to do what his topic was about.
- Abu Yera gave a good talk on ransomware and the history of EDR and responses to ransomware. I didn’t retain a ton of notes on anything new and exciting though.
- My final session was with Atlas of Doom. Full disclosure I used to work with Matt at a prior employer and I consider him a friend. I like his talks because he talks about the people. I think that that is just so so important. We need good people to do good work in this domain.

## #misec meetup

On Thursday we had a #misec meetup. I think we had like 30 people that showed up for some food, drinks, networking, and social time. I’m so glad that it came together like it did. While I won’t remember every name at the very least I’ll remember some faces! 

## final takeaways

- I found many sessions lacking this year. I don’t know if this is a case of presenters fibbing during the call for papers; if the people who choose the presentations not understanding the material; or something else. 
- I should define a good presentation: It should be (1) Engaging; (2) Understandable; (3) MUST NOT RECOMMEND A VENDOR; and (4) Should include actionable information.
- As a member of the #misec Board of Directors it is imperative that we get booth space and meetup space moving forward. 
- The second day of presentations was much better in terms of content. For the most part. 
- I will be submitting a presentation next year! The topic will be “Pathways to Cybersecurity” and specifically focused on my background and how I got into this domain. It will be aimed at college students, hiring managers, and anyone who wants to work in “cybersecurity” but currently does not.

---

Once again it was a great year at GrrCon. I think I spent more time with vendors and with friends than ever before. Hopefully next year we can have some fresh content and maybe even a #misec conference. :-)
